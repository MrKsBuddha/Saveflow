💸 SaveFlow

SaveFlow is a smart monthly budget and savings tracking application that helps users manage expenses, automatically calculate savings, and handle overspending by deducting from accumulated savings — all with clear history and visual insights.

🚀 What is SaveFlow?

SaveFlow is built around a simple but powerful idea:

Every month has a fixed budget.
If you spend less → you save money.
If you spend more → savings are used automatically.

It removes confusion and helps users clearly see where their money goes and how much they actually save over time.

✨ Key Features

✅ Monthly budget management (editable anytime)

🧾 Add expenses with amount, reason, and auto-saved date

🔁 Automatic savings carry-forward every month

⚠️ Overspending automatically deducted from savings

📉 Debt tracking when savings are exhausted

📆 Month-wise expense history

📊 Visual analytics (expenses vs budget, savings growth)

🔐 Secure authentication (JWT-based)

☁️ Cloud-backed storage (PostgreSQL)

📱 Mobile-first, responsive UI

🧠 Core Concept

Each month works like a container:

Budget is fixed (e.g. ₹1000)

Expenses are added during the month

At month end:

Unused money → Savings

Overspent money → Deducted from Savings

Savings persist month-to-month

History is never modified retroactively
